    <h1 id="ten">Proposal</h1>
    <p id= "two">Here at Dog Tech Industries we look to give your curiosity the answers it needs! You no longer need to ask "What kind of dog is that?", all you need to do is Point and Click with Paw Patrol!</p>
    <p id= "two">Paw Patrol is an image recognition software that correctly determins the breed of dog from the image given. It allows the user to quickly take an image of a dog and then compare that image to the ones in the database and it returns the type of dog. The software doesn't work for mixed breeds currently but will broaden the scope of breeds in the future.</p>

    <h1 id="nine">Feasibility</h1>
    <p id= "two">This project will require two major resources: an image dataset of different dog breeds and an algorithm we can train with these images; both are readily available online. Members of our group have experience and background in HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript and Python; all languages that are needed to build this software and an accompanying webpage. </p>
    <p id= "two">Thus, considering the expertise of our team members and the availability of multiple necessary resources, executing the required tasks for this project and developing a working software product by the due date is very feasible.</p>

    <h1 id="ten">Demand</h1>
    <p id= "two">People who want to know what breed a dog on the street is could use this to find out. There is a dog scanner app at #131 in the education apps on the Apple App Store with 22,700+ ratings. This app contains $1.49-13.99 in-app purchases. There is a demand for dog breed recognition. However, it may is arduous to move into a market with other players such as Microsoft and apps that have been around for 5+ years.</p>
    <p id= "two">There is also a company called Finding Rover that uses animal facial recognition to identify missing pets and helps reunite owners with them. This app partnered with Petco a, $4.1 billion company.</p>
    <p id= "two">There is demand for such technology. The difficulty will be implementing it in a unique way that will garner the attention that avoids competition.</p>

    <h1 id="ten">Software Maintenance</h1>
    <p id= "two">Despite us having a product that can identify ten different dog breeds very accurately there are a few things that we plan on implementing in the future. One of the ways we want to build upon our project is to increase the number of dog breeds that it can identify. We were limited to only ten breeds because of how long it takes to train the program. Decreasing the time it takes to run is another thing that we will look to improve on in the future, we don’t want to have to retrain the program every time we run it. Lastly, after we make our program run faster we will boost the number of epochs in the code and doing so will improve the accuracy.</p>
