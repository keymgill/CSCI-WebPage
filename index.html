    <h1 id="ten">Proposal</h1>
    <p id= "two">Here at Dog Tech Industries we look to give your curiosity the answers it needs! You no longer need to ask "What kind of dog is that?", all you need to do is Point and Click with Paw Patrol!</p>
    <p id= "two">Paw Patrol is an image recognition software that correctly determins the breed of dog from the image given. It allows the user to quickly take an image of a dog and then compare that image to the ones in the database and it returns the type of dog. The software doesn't work for mixed breeds currently but will broaden the scope of breeds in the future.</p>

    <h1 id="nine">Feasibility</h1>
    <p id= "two">This project will require two major resources: an image dataset of different dog breeds and an algorithm we can train with these images; both are readily available online. Members of our group have experience and background in HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript and Python; all languages that are needed to build this software and an accompanying webpage. </p>
    <p id= "two">Thus, considering the expertise of our team members and the availability of multiple necessary resources, executing the required tasks for this project and developing a working software product by the due date is very feasible.</p>
