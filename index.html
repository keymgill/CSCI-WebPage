    <p id= "two">This project will require two major resources: an image dataset of different dog breeds and an algorithm we can train with these images; both are readily available online. Members of our group have experience and background in HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript and Python; all languages that are needed to build this software and an accompanying webpage. </p>
    <p id= "two">Thus, considering the expertise of our team members and the availability of multiple necessary resources, executing the required tasks for this project and developing a working software product by the due date is very feasible.</p>
